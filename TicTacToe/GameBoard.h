//The GameBoard holds the nine Tiles that make up the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Since my concept was that the human player would play against the board itself,
//this class also has the functions necessary to calculate the computer's move.
//Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple and thoroughly solved game, so I did not implement a minmax-style algorithm for the AI. Instead, on each turn, the AI
//iterates through a flow-chart that leads it reliably to a draw or a win. I decided that randomization and board rotations for variety were outside the scope
//of this project.
